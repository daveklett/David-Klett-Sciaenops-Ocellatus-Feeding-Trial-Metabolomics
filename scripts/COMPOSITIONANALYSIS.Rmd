This is the analysis of the data received from Clemson. I will use ANOVAs to determine statistical differences between diets, and use post hoc testing to determine statistical groupings. 
```{r}
comp <- composition_data
comp$treatment <- as.factor(comp$treatment)
comp$treatment = factor(comp$treatment,c("COND","FSHSQ","FSH","FSQ","SHSQ","F","SH","SQ","PELL"))


#Percent Fat per diet linear model; models Percent Fat of diets and compares to see if there are differences
lmfat <- lm(comp$`crude fat` ~ comp$treatment[comp$tissue == "wf"], data = comp)
summary(lmfat)
aovfat <- aov(comp$`crude fat` ~ comp$treatment, data =comp)
summary(aovfat)
aovfat
posthocfat <- TukeyHSD(x=aovfat, 'comp$treatment', conf.level=0.99)
posthocfat
