individuals_data

This file includes data from the final time week 12 sampling. We sacrificed 72 individuals, 3 per tank, 9 per treatment, and took the following data for each fish (column name):
* Fish identification (fishid)
* Weight in grams (wt)
* Total Length (tlmm)
* Liver weight in grams (liverwt)
* Weight in grams after removing liver and viscera (evisceratedwt)
* Condition factor: weight/total length (conditionfactor)
* Difference in weight before and after evisceration (wtdiff)
* Percent viscera weight of body weight (percentviscera)
* Heposomatic index: liver weight/total length (hsi)



diets_data 

This file includes data from the final time week 12 sampling. This is average values of tanks, so 3 replicates of each diet. The file includes the following data (column name):

* Whole fish (wf) or muscle fillet (f) sample
* Total length (tlmm)
* Weight in grams (wt)
* Weight of the tray in grams (traywt)
* Tray weight and sample initial weight (both)
* Feb 28 (day0)
* *Leap year, so day 1 was Feb 29
* March 4 (day5) weights drying
* March 5 (day6) weights drying
* March 6 (day7) weights drying: final weights in grams of samples
* H2O percent of initial weight as a proportion (h2o)
* Dry matter percent of initial weight as a proportion (drymatter)
