# This project will analyse my Master's Thesis data in preparation for a completed thesis and publication. It will produce figures, 
# analyses, and help keep all of my data in one place that is in a format easily shared and worked on with my advisor and 
# collaborators. They will be able to use R to look at my data as well. This will also be used for the project in R class with
# Dr. Dan McGlinn.
