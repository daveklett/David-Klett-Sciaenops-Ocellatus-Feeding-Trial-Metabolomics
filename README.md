# David-Klett-Sciaenops-Ocellatus-Feeding-Trial-Metabolomics

This project will analyse my Master's Thesis data in preparation for a completed thesis and publication. It will produce figures, analyses, and help keep all of my data in one place that is in a format easily shared and worked on with my advisor and  collaborators. They will be able to use R to look at my data as well. This will also be used for the project in R class with Dr. Dan McGlinn.

The purpose of this research is to use NMR based metabolomics to bridge the performance gap between natural diets and commercial non-fishmeal-based pelleted feeds in red drum growout. The data came from a 12-week feeding trial where red drum fingerlings were fed isocalorically different natural diets and a commercial fishmeal-based pelleted feed. Livers were extracted to be run through NMR to identify metabolites that can be supplemented to improve the performance of non-fishmeal-based feeds.

Datasets used in this project can be foung in the data directory, figures produced can be found in the figs directory, and code in the code directory. The data used in this project is from my thesis and original work. 

A summary explanation of each dataset and what they read can be found in the data folder in the metadata.txt file.

This project statistically analyses the important and significant data from my research, while setting up coe for my future data that has yet to be collected.

I would like to aknowledge my advisor Dr. Aaron Watson (SCDNR), my committee members Dr. Fabio Casu, Dr. Jody Beers, and Dr. Mike Janech for their guidance and support so far in developing and executing my thesis project. I would like to thank the Slocum Lunz Grant and the SCDNR for their funding and the faculty at the Graduate Program in Marine Biology for their help and guidance. Last I want to thank my fiance Jolie, and my family and God for their encouragement and consistant help to push me forward in my graduate studies.
