This project will analyse my Master's Thesis data in preparation for a completed thesis and publication. It will produce figures, analyses, and help keep all of my data in one place that is in a format easily shared and worked on with my advisor and  collaborators. They will be able to use R to look at my data as well. This will also be used for the project in R class with Dr. Dan McGlinn.

Datasets used in this project can be foung in the data directory, figures produced can be found in the figs directory, and code in the code directory. The data used in this project is from my thesis and original work. 

This project statistically analyses the important and significant data from my research, while setting up coe for my future data that has yet to be collected.
