1. individuals_data

This file includes data from the final time week 12 sampling. We sacrificed 72 individuals, 3 per tank, 9 per treatment, and took the following data for each fish (column name):
* Fish identification (fishid)
* Weight in grams (wt)
* Total Length (tlmm)
* Liver weight in grams (liverwt)
* Weight in grams after removing liver and viscera (evisceratedwt)
* Condition factor: weight/total length (conditionfactor)
* Difference in weight before and after evisceration (wtdiff)
* Percent viscera weight of body weight (percentviscera)
* Heposomatic index: liver weight/total length (hsi)



2. allfish_data

This file includes data from the 72 fish sacrificed at the conclusion of the feeding trial for livers and the 80 fish sacrificed at the conclusion of the feeding trial for muscle and whole body composition analysis, and includes the following data (column name):
*Fish identification d1..., or 1..., signifying dried for composition analysis or sampled for liver (fishid)
*If fish was taken at sampling or dried in oven (collection)
*Treatment (diet)
*Total Weight of fish (wt)
*Total Length of fish (tlmm)



3. dryfishweights_data

This file includes data from drying whole fish and muscle samples for proximate analysis. I dried the samples in an oven at 80 degrees C for 1 week. The data taken is as follows (column name):
* Fish identification (Fish)
* Tray identification in oven (trayid)
* Diet number (treatment)
* Whole fish (wf) or muscle fillet (f) sample
* Total length (tlmm)
* Weight in grams (wt)
* Weight of the tray in grams (traywt)
* Tray weight and sample initial weight (both)
* Feb 28 (day0)
* *Leap year, so day 1 was Feb 29
* March 4 (day5) weights drying
* March 5 (day6) weights drying
* March 6 (day7) weights drying: final weights in grams of samples
* H2O percent of initial weight as a proportion (h2o)
* Dry matter percent of initial weight as a proportion (drymatter)



4. bucketexample2_data

This file includes data from a past feeding trial and the resulting NMR data from three of the treatments (initial, cut diet, and a soybean diet). The dataset is given as follows (column name)
Rows are very small increments along an x-axis
Columns are fish identifiers 
***This dataset is transposed in my code to be properly read in r for pca analysis



5. bucketexample2_data.env

This file shows the type of environment the bucketexample2_data dataset includes. It really is just telling us what treatment each individual fish received. This is to help tease apart the data in pca.



6. dailywaterquality_data

This file includes the water quality measurements that were taken every 2 days for the whole feeding trial. The data is given as follows (column name):
*Date taken, which is the same for the 5 rows below each date entry (date)
*Tank Number (tank)
*Temperature in Celcius (temp)
*Dissolved Oxygen in mg/L (do)
*Salinity in ppt (sal)
*pH (pH)



7. weeklywaterquality_data

This file includes the water quality measurements that were taken every week during the whole feeding trial. The data is given as follows (column name):
*Week of feeding trial (week)
*Date of measurements (date)
*Tank number (tank)
*Ammonia levels (Ammonia mg/L)
*Nitrite levels (Nitrite mg/L)
*Nitrate levels (Nitrate mg/L)



8. justinwt_data

This file shows the average fish weight derived from taking the total biomass of each tank at the conclusion of the feeding trial. The fish were sein netted out of the tanks and weighed, then averaged by dividing biomass by the number of fish in the tank. The individual tank numbers do not matter for this data. The data is given as follows (column name):
*Treatment (diet)
*Average fish weight (wt)
*Specific Growth Rate for each tank (sgr)
